#Installation

### Using CocoaPods

FLAlertView is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'FLAlertView'
```

### Manually

Clone or Download this Repo. Then simply drag the folder ```FLAlertView``` to your Xcode project. Please make sure to drag the whole folder, which includes assets needed for some alert types.

### SwiftPM

You can use "Xcode/File/Swift Packages/Add Package Dependency..." and write github url:
``` https://github.com/felarmir/FLAlertView.git ```

# Example

FLAlertView comes with an example app that you can use to try out all of the customizations below. It's recommended that you go through all of the docs before using the example app. To use the example app, clone or download FLAlertView, open and run ```Example/FLAlertView.xcworkspace```.

#Adding FLAlertView

Start by adding the following to your desired View Controller:

```Swift
import FLAlertView
```

### Presenting an FLAlertView

```Swift
let alert = FLAlertView()

alert.showAlert(inView: self,
				withTitle: "Alert Title",
				withSubtitle: "This is your alert's subtitle. Keep it short and concise. üòúüëå",
				withCustomImage: nil,
				withDoneButtonTitle: nil,
				andButtons: nil)
```

## Base Customizations

- **Title (String?):** You can leave the Title as ```nil``` or Give it a ```String```.

- **Subtitle (String):** FLAlertView always requires a subtitle, even if you want just a few words, add it here instead of the title (then leave the title as nil). *Take a look at [Screenshot 2](https://github.com/nimati/FCAlertView/blob/master/Images/ScreenShots/ScreenShot2.png) for an example*.

-  **CustomImage (UIImage?):** You can leave this image as ```nil``` or Give it a ```UIImage``` which will show at the top of the alert. *Take a look at [Screenshot 4](https://github.com/nimati/FCAlertView/blob/master/Images/ScreenShots/ScreenShot4.png) for an example*.

- **DoneButtonTitle (String?):** You can leave this as ```nil``` to show "Ok" as the dismiss button for the AlertView, or Give it an ```String```.

- **Buttons ([String]?):** If you want to add buttons to your alert, simply add an array of 1 or 2 button titles as ```String``` here, anything more will be ignored as 2 is the max custom buttons you can add (aside from the done button). Read more about buttons and actions further down.

## Extra Customizations

This section includes all the tiny details that you can customize your alert with, which makes FLAlertView very customizable. Or leave it as is and enjoy the simplicity.

### Color Scheme

By default, FLAlertView doesn't include a color scheme, much like UIAlertView, but you can add one by adding this line:

```Swift

alert.colorScheme = UIColor(red: 150/255, green: 150/255, blue: 150/255, alpha: 1)
```

FLAlertView also comes with a set of pre-made colors that you can use:

#####*Credit goes to [flatuicolors.com](http://flatuicolors.com) for the Beautiful Palette of Flat Colors*

Simply choose the color you'd like to use for your AlertView, and add:

```Swift
alert.colorScheme = UIColor.flatBlue // Replace "Blue" with your preferred color from the image above
alert.colorScheme = .flatBlue // Alternative
```

### Title and Subtitle Colors

#### Change Title Color by Adding one of:

```Swift
alert.titleColor = UIColor.flatPurple
alert.titleColor = .flatPurple
```

#### Change SubTitle Color by Adding one of

```Swift
alert.subTitleColor = UIColor.flatBlue
alert.subTitleColor = .flatBlue
```

### AlertView Rounded Corners

Change the Rounding of the FLAlertView's corners as desired using:

```Colors
alert.cornerRadius = 4 // Replace 4 with your desired corner radius amount (Set to 0.1 if you don't want rounding)
```

### Alert Types

FLAlertView comes with 3 pre-designed custom alert types. Success, Caution, or Warning, simply add the type while initializing the FLAlertView.

#### Success

```Swift
let alert = FLAlertView(type: .success)
```

#### Caution

```Swift
let alert = FLAlertView(type: .caution)
```

#### Warning

```Swift
let alert = FLAlertView(type: .warning)
```

### Dismissing FLAlertView

There are multiple ways you can dismiss an FLAlertView

#### Close on Outside Touch

When the user taps anywhere outside the alert, you can dismiss it by adding this line:

```Swift
alert.dismissOnOutsideTouch = true
```

#### Auto-Close the Alert

Dismiss the AlertView when a certain time has elapsed after the AlertView is presented, by adding this line:

```Swift
alert.autoHideSeconds = 5 // Replace 5 with the number of Seconds you'd like the view to appear for before dismissing itself
```

#### Done Button or Any Custom Buttons

All Buttons including the Done/Dismiss Button will make the FLAlertView dismiss.

#### Dismissing it yourself

If you'd like to dismiss the AlertView yourself, simply add the following line to where you need it:

```Swift
alert.dismissAlertView()
```

### Hiding Done/Dismiss Button

If you'd like to have no buttons on your AlertView (to simply display a notification or approval of something) or you want all your buttons to be a custom one which you've added yourself. Simply hide the Done buttons by adding this line:

```Swift
alert.hideDoneButton = true
```

### Hiding All Buttons

If you'd like to simply hide all buttons from your alert, you can do so by adding this line:

```Swift
alert.hideAllButtons = true
```

# Button Actions

To add actions to your buttons, you have to first delegate your FLAlertView with your view, and then add a helper method which will detect button touches. Here's how you can add an alert with buttons and perform actions:

Add your FLAlertView with Buttons where you need to present it:

```Swift
let alert = FLAlertView();

alert.delegate = self

alert.showAlert(inView: self,
             withTitle: "Alert Title",
          withSubtitle: "This is your alert's subtitle. Keep it short and concise. üòúüëå",
       withCustomImage: nil,
   withDoneButtonTitle: "Done")

```

After adding your FLAlertView, you can detect button touches by adding this closures:

```Swift

alert.addAction(title: "Cancel",
                 type: .cancel) {
            // action
}

```
